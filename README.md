DB Backend (Zapatos Replacement)

### About the Project

GMetri APIs uses Zapatos (Open Source, MIT License) for TypeSafe SQL queries.

Zapatosâ€™s current version is v6. 

But Zapatos above version 2 no longer has the ability to work with multiple schemas in the same repo. The version of Typescript in Zapatos is getting outdated, and will soon be incompatible with GMetri codebase.

### Task

Fork or recreate Zapatos with the latest version of Typescript

**Requirements:**

Create type safe .ts files in the same repo, which can be included in downstream repos.

### **Technology Stack**

Postgres SQL, TypeScript 

### **Resources**

[https://jawj.github.io/zapatos/](https://jawj.github.io/zapatos/) 

### **Evaluation Criteria**

Is GMetri able to replace Zapatos with the new library?
